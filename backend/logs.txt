It could write a powerful version of google translate in 5 minutes.\\n---\\n​@alakshieConsider reading about the Dunning Kreuger effect. You seem to be a poor sufferer\\n---\\nHow can I use sarvam.m\\n---\\nHopefully they add it soon\\n---\\nwhere is the link to try bro?... nothing in description...how can people believe without any proof to try...just a pretty AD thats it?\\n---\\nPlease add dark theme and upload file feature 👍🏻\\n---\\nAI race is test cricket not T20\\n---\\nDark mode pls\\n---\\n@blackcatpirates8134 How is this tricking people?

It is definitely revolutionary.\\n---\\n​@d_roy_ they might hallucinate for 'marathi-gujrathi' task. But the original comment was talking about english-indian languages. And they don't hallucinate that often. I know because we have lambda functions set up for automatic internationalisation. You are being defensive for no reason. The future of all LLMs is local.\\n---\\nThere are open source models to do that already\\n---\\nGo to their website?\\n---\\n@MAHI-fo5sr Aa jaega kuch din mein ,inki site par diya h 30B aur 105B mode coming soon for chats\\n---\\nApp kab aayegi\\n---\\nYou guys are awesomee!!! Please release paid products so we can pay somehow and contribute\\n---\\nWorld class presentation.\\n---\\n@MAHI-fo5sr It is an ai chatbot as well\\n---\\nCan we get the benchmark results\\n---\\nneeds as much funding as possible from government ngl\\n---\\n@massiah1298 this generic norm also most indian competitors cant replicate 😂 so atleast they standing on business\\n---\\n​@Prashant_Pandey4app bhi laa rhe hai ye log\\n---\\nLet's make saravam a world class ai model....Made in India makes us proud ❤❤\\nPlease make this available for the Indian public as soon as possible...we can definitely beat chatgpt and Gemini❤\\nAlways with you guys\\n---\\nAll the best\\n---\\n​@EndianCitizen108I see, well I still need to see more because tricking people isn't as impressive as it used to seem nowadays, people get tricked by many things lol. But yeah, it's definitely a good news.\\n---\\nBrilliant work guys✌️🇮🇳. Keep going🔱\\n---\\nFeedback: i used the TTS but it breaks and is inconsistent many times, also hinglish should be added as a language\\n---\\nWe need a full featured app like Chatgpt and Gemini. And there should also be free use options for students in addition to paid. 👍\\n---\\nFor gods sake please send some of your UX/UI designers to the government departments  to make their websites and save us from unbearable embarassment🙏🙏\\n---\\nsanskrit hai kya\\n---\\nRooting for you guys(developers).

Bhai indian aise hi badnaam hei copy karne aur labour work karne mei...\\nSo hire creative design Thinkers... Jo apko better ideas and inovative visual and composition k liye suggestions de sake...\\nFocus on design and branding....yeh koi inovative tool ni hei already copy paste hei bas context indian hei...\\nHire inovative kids, gaon dihat mei jao waha milega apko inovative childs IIT, NID jaise design certificate ab old school ho chuke hei...😅😅\\n\\nAur specially India ka 99% private universities, institute are same As the fraud Galgotiya University.

That's a given. Your point?\\n---\\nI am from Kolkata\\n---\\nLook. I really want India to make great strides in AI. But, let's be honest. This is most likely a wrapper around Claude or ChatGPT. If not, can you tell me which data center in India has the capability for running LLMs at scale?\\n---\\nPrathyush kumar\\n---\\nAb kon bolega.l :  india= astrotalk 😂\\n---\\nI don’t know why you’re impressed. I’m questioning your skills as a designer.\\nThe font used is literally Google sans- Google’s own font \\nThe cursor used here is a blatant copy of figma’s cursor design. \\nThe design is very generic and overused no originality and doesn’t feel “indian” which everyone seems to ravaging about.\\n---\\nIts childs play with Higgsfield Vibe motion AI.\\n---\\nImprove Lip sink and European and Asian languages\\n---\\nThey are only targeting major languages which are used in India mostly for now. They will slowly integrate every language and dialects. India has too many languages and it is hard to integrate them all at once. It will be a long process and can take upto many years even\\n---\\nAdd plug and play pipelines practices in studio\\n---\\ncould have done better sound design like clicking effects\\n---\\nInvideo bhi india ka\\n---\\nWhat about coding? That's the real benchmark. Language is the easiest frontier with LLMs. ChatGPT did it 4 years ago\\n---\\nYeah, I don't understand why others can't see that\\n---\\nଓଡ଼ିଆ ଭାଷା?\\n---\\nNow we can proudly say that Sarvam is India's answer to ChatGPTs and Deepseek's of the World 🇮🇳\\n---\\nRemove \\"build for India\\", make it build for the world.\\n---\\nIt's nice to see that India is trying not to be far away from US and China! IMHO India is doing better than Europe with exception of Mistral\\n---\\n@DeepSpaceDock now go check\\n---\\nWhat's that banger of a  background music\\n---\\nWhere's the product demo?\\n---\\nWell Done SARVAM AI ❤💪🇮🇳\\n---\\n​@bhootkimkcyeah\\n---\\nThis can either be revolutionary or overhyped, I'm betting towards the former.\\n---\\nIs Sarvam AI giving API? \\nIs it free?\\n---\\nNeed photo generation / background changing as per the requirements/ photo editing too....\\nChecked sarvam ai....but there is no any option...and should have to be unlimited.....\\nDetailed information regarding anything...\\nJust because of that gemini is still far ahead to evert platform...\\nWant sarvam to implement these things\\n---\\nIm still not satisfied why didn you put my tribs language ik from arunachalpradesh I want adi(abhor) language and translations too just putting mainland languages won't work. If it has to be it must evn put all tribal languages from northeast as well that's justice and equality\\n---\\nWhy continue with google or continue with Microsoft only, why there is no option to continue with email id ?\\n---\\nGreat work.\\n---\\nHi, if you can build a product to understand dog language, every pet lover will buy your product. Same with cat, cow! GCC in no time\\n---\\ndo this provide embedding models, can someone provide me support\\n---\\nAnother wrapper hoax\\n---\\n​@MAHI-fo5srhogaya bhai search Indus by sarvam.\\nUse it's good but I think thoda server issue hai because bahut ne download Kiya hai\\n---\\n​@editingstyle-i2jit has become a norm... Ui seems generic..\\n---\\nI keep coming back to listen the background music\\n---\\nA browser extension for yt, fb, insta would be great as well\\n---\\nSeems to be good ..nice all the best\\n---\\nplz add text to image and video feature also...like seedance\\n---\\nMake target audience as content creators is good but increasing audience is important\\n---\\n@bhootkimkc We need a revolution like Nepal. System won't change that easily.\\n---\\nPlease fix the careers page.\\n---\\nDoes your ai support Sanskrit?\\n---\\nhmm who's your designer. using google sans, and js straight up copying Figma's cursor design. why cant anything that comes out of our country feel authentic\\n---\\nHe has no idea about UX/UI that's why impressed.😂Also take a good look at their pricing 😅\\n---\\nUr very close to agentic AI..we would like to see it soon\\n---\\nPlease need app 🙏\\nFrom Nepal \\nSupporting Indian 😊\\n---\\nTarget entire world not india specific\\n---\\nWill it generate photos?\\n---\\n@tidehunter-r4vapparently this is the most accurate one for indian language.\\n---\\nHogya hai Indus ai by sarvam abhi beta form me hai download it\\n---\\nWe need to change the leaders first. The current ones are totally uneducated. Even if they reach out to masses they spew venom only.\\n---\\nApp kab launch hoga ?\\n---\\nUse Indus chatbot by Sarvam.\\n---\\nProud of india\\n---\\n​@aryansrivastava3029 is it confirmed?\\n---\\nPls release an application for this\\n---\\nNo pictures upload options & pictures generation options😢\\n---\\nIt should be open source\\n---\\n​@SUNs1591We will see\\n---\\nHow many languages and dialects does it handle?

The links don't work (the paperform ones)? Thanks\\n---\\nFor creating projects, is the change worth it, going from Cursor which is already proven to work for full project development or migrate to AntiGravity agents developments platform?

Greatly appreciate a straightforward answer\\n---\\nclaude code is paid, antigravity is free\\n---\\nYou can do the same in Claude.\\n---\\ni still dont know the difference between claude and antigravity skills. My cli claude creates its own script to streamline skill usage without me telling it to.\\n---\\nHowdy Brother 💪\\n\\n🤔 How to use Skills\\n1) Create a skill for anything that you use frequently (Publishing to a service, design work, research, scraping, etc)\\n2) test the skill and make sure it does exactly what you want\\n3) When you ask anti-gravity to do that thing, it will automatically use the skill (meaning you get high quality output every time)\\n4) Add the skills to any project you want. \\n\\n💪 Why you need them (and how the compare)\\n1) Persona = how the agent behaves. Rules = constraints. Workflows = pipelines.\\n2) Skills = reusable abilities the agent can invoke when it detects intent \\n3) TL;DR: You teach it ONCE how to do a task properly, and it becomes muscle memory.\\n4) Value: you get consistency, speed, and portability across every project.\\n\\n\\n⚡ When do you need them? (MCPs)\\n1) MCPs give AntiGravity data and the ability to connect to anything\\n2) You do not need skills to use your MCP\\n3) You will use the skills anytime you want the outcome for the skill. So for example, if I created a skill for scraping reddit, anytime I ask anti-gravity scraping reddit it will activate the skill. Meaning I don't have to explain in great detail how to do it and it doesn't need to figure out anymore because it's a predefined skill. \\n\\nI hope that makes sense. I'm going to be doing a full anti-gravity masterclass where I'll go into more detail or you can join me for the catch up on Friday if you're in the community. Let me know if you have any further questions 🙏\\n---\\nHahahaha 1000%\\n---\\nJust keep in mind that you are sharing everything from your project with google, probably the worst company when it comes to privacy protection.\\n---\\ndidnt knew antigravity updated this much, tried it after it came out and it was mehh\\n---\\nLink in bio, its working now broski 💪\\n---\\n\\"Imagine if you could build anything faster...\\"  - A.I.\\n---\\nHow is this different with Cursor's skills?\\n---\\nYo buddy, the skills file isnt working :(.

But if you're unsure, just import the skills to the project and you'll be golden.\\n---\\nJack, love the videos..but slow down and stick to 1 thing per video. I'll get 5 mins into your video, and already things aren't working right. My GitHub doesn't like to work with aistudios so I can't pull my repo into aistudio after I make the rough draft\\n---\\n@jaybeatz8084The comment was about how they handle skills specifically, not the general differences in CC vs. Antigravity.\\n---\\nhmmm ok nahh.\\n---\\nwhere is free trial? i tried and still say 77 usd\\n---\\nI noticed you’re using that speech-to-text tool in your video, but is it only available for Apple and not for Windows?\\n---\\nPlease tell me how you get your mouse pointer to slightly reduce its size when you click or hold on something and then it jumps back into place \\n\\nBeen trying to get it for long, but dont know how or where, And ChatGPT doesn't understand me when I ask it🙏🏻\\n---\\nYo! Looking to pay someone for cold Email help. \\n\\nEasy gig. Already have paying clients. Too many. I’ll hand you lists, AI personalization, as much intel as you need to do your job. \\n\\nyou’ll never have to get onto a client meeting.. you don’t even have to answer replies. And you definitely don’t need to build your own list.\\n\\nI build scrapers and AI systems for a living. Personalization, hyper targeting, whatever you need.\\n\\nI need someone who can simply hop in and write some campaigns, iterate on analytics and responses, and own the performance of the \\"interested reply rate.\\"\\n\\njust need to hop on a call with me once a month, and put a few hours in twice a month. \\n\\nCopy, strategy, analysis. \\n\\nPaid gig. it’s literally that simple. If this works out and everything is good, easy route to more stuff.\\n\\nfor context, I sell intelligence and data mining to a few niches. It’s an easy upsell to cold email if they happen to be looking for opportunities. I’ve done well with it but now it’s more than I can handle.\\n\\nIf you’re interested, let m know.\\n---\\nJack, as much as I appreciate your videos and your hard work and effort put into it.\\nWe need to understand:\\n\\n- How do you use these skills\\n- Why do we need them and how do they compare to personas, rules, workflows\\n- When do you need them? to run MCPs?\\n\\nI think this video is great but ALOT of confusion is around antigravitys ecosystem and its use-cases and how you verify and trigger them.\\n---\\nWhere can I get the Skills/see your slides? The links don't work (the paperform ones)? Thanks\\n---\\nFor creating projects, is the change worth it, going from Cursor which is already proven to work for full project development or migrate to AntiGravity agents developments platform? I am a pure vibe coder building a SaaS business right now. Greatly appreciate a straightforward answer\\n---\\nclaude code is paid, antigravity is free\\n---\\nYou can do the same in Claude.\\n---\\ni still dont know the difference between claude and antigravity skills. My cli claude creates its own script to streamline skill usage without me telling it to.\\n---\\nHowdy Brother 💪\\n\\n🤔 How to use Skills\\n1) Create a skill for anything that you use frequently (Publishing to a service, design work, research, scraping, etc)\\n2) test the skill and make sure it does exactly what you want\\n3) When you ask anti-gravity to do that thing, it will automatically use the skill (meaning you get high quality output every time)\\n4) Add the skills to any project you want. \\n\\n💪 Why you need them (and how the compare)\\n1) Persona = how the agent behaves. Rules = constraints. Workflows = pipelines.\\n2) Skills = reusable abilities the agent can invoke when it detects intent \\n3) TL;DR: You teach it ONCE how to do a task properly, and it becomes muscle memory.\\n4) Value: you get consistency, speed, and portability across every project.\\n\\n\\n⚡ When do you need them? (MCPs)\\n1) MCPs give AntiGravity data and the ability to connect to anything\\n2) You do not need skills to use your MCP\\n3) You will use the skills anytime you want the outcome for the skill. So for example, if I created a skill for scraping reddit, anytime I ask anti-gravity scraping reddit it will activate the skill. Meaning I don't have to explain in great detail how to do it and it doesn't need to figure out anymore because it's a predefined skill. \\n\\nI hope that makes sense. I'm going to be doing a full anti-gravity masterclass where I'll go into more detail or you can join me for the catch up on Friday if you're in the community. Let me know if you have any further questions 🙏\\n---\\nHahahaha 1000%\\n---\\nJust keep in mind that you are sharing everything from your project with google, probably the worst company when it comes to privacy protection.\\n---\\ndidnt knew antigravity updated this much, tried it after it came out and it was mehh\\n---\\nLink in bio, its working now broski 💪\\n---\\n\\"Imagine if you could build anything faster...\\"  - A.I.\\n---\\nHow is this different with Cursor's skills?\\n---\\nYo buddy, the skills file isnt working :(.

I can’t wait!\\n---\\nThis looks breathtaking.\\n---\\nLet's hope we see an MC Liu Kang who could go toe to toe with Shao Kahn.\\n---\\nTHIS LOOKS SO GOOD!!!!🥲🥲🥲\\n---\\nBooking it! Lifelong mk fan....\\n---\\nKarl Urban is fine but...that role doesn't suit him anymore. Man, it really should have been The Miz\\n---\\nRaiden: Billy Butcher, you have been chosen for Mortal Ko--\\n\\nButcher: Ye ye ye, fork off there, sunshine\\n---\\nMortal Kombat II: A Johnny Cage Story\\n---\\nAll you have to do is have scorpion saying \\"Get over here\\" for me to watch\\n---\\nJohnny is definitely about to hit that glow kick at the end of the trailer. I can’t wait\\n---\\nSo happy can’t wait just 3 months away\\n---\\nOne of the best instant recharge music\\n---\\nOi hughie im in mortal kombat\\n---\\nAbsolutely Brutality❤ Nostalgic Fatality❤….\\n---\\nDamm the music and the VFX looks amazing!\\n---\\nWhere tf sub zero?\\n---\\nThis is going to be incredible 😳👏🔥\\n---\\nCritics can go watch The Sheep Detectives - this one right here is for the fans🤜🏼🤛🏼\\n---\\nab maaza aayega\\n---\\nIs joe taslim still being the subzero?\\n---\\nI've been sold on this movie ever since they cast Karl Urban as Johnny Cage. This is gonna be great!\\n---\\nThis looks absolutely dope!!!\\nThis is the Mortal Kombat we've been waiting for since the first Mortal Kombat movie in 1996!!\\n\\n*Still not sure if they chose the right Johnny Cage, (he was good in The Boys tho) but I'm still on board. \\nLet's go!!!\\n---\\nNeeds way more Kano.\\n---\\nStill will never understand why they turned the most beautiful women in the history of MK into Brown Caillou\\n---\\nThe only thing that bothers me is that there's over 100 characters and they choose Johnny Cage and Katana as the main ones I hope the movie does justice no hate on Karl Urban I love his energy imo his character is boring I'm talking too soon maybe I'm wrong and it'll satisfy me 😂\\n---\\nI'm so glad they kept going with this version despite the nay sayers after the first movie.  It wasn't good, there's no denying that, but it was enjoyable but it had so much potential.  It's good they're leaning into that potential.\\n---\\nmy idol is Scorpion.. 🥰RIP to Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa aka. Shang Tsun 🙏\\n---\\nThey better not save the shadow kick for the very end 😂\\n---\\nI love it ❤\\n---\\nbeautiful 2001 visual effects <3\\n---\\nWhere is Cole Young?\\n---\\nGoosebumps!\\n---\\noh ok, this fan made still lit\\n---\\nwhy was scott adkins not johnny cage...?\\n---\\nyh cole is dying\\n---\\nTrailer's good 👍\\n---\\nfinish hii*crack voice*mm\\n---\\nCharlie the Unicorn as Johnny Cage\\n---\\nI liked cole. I hope he plays a bignpart in this.\\n---\\nflawless victory\\n---\\n- I want to hear \\"COME HEREEE!!!\\"\\n- The fight scene motions are a little slow.\\n- Did I just see Raiden do his tackle fly, love it. He better yell \\"GeT BaCK iN tHe Caaar\\" and do the flip after it. I don't know what he really says either, lol.\\n- Did I wish the whole cast would be in their late 20's-early 30's? Yes but, I guess this series is about maturing with us the players, we got older so did they. And plus if you had the chance to play as one of your influential figures from your youth. Would you pass that up and not honor a game that formed friendships?\\n- I would love to hear \\"Immortal by Adema\\" playing on with someone working out or one of the fighters saying \\"You can't kill me. I'm Immortal\\" then boom the song starts playing.\\n---\\nhe’s never gonna kill bloody homelander\\n---\\nLooks wild. The nostalgic game just keeps on going. Blessings to you all on your journeys! - John 11:25-26\\n---\\nWhere is vidhut jamwal ??\\n---\\nSaibot better get justice\\n---\\nThat was a very epic sounding trailer. Even the visuals look a lot better.\\n---\\nYour soul is forever. Rest in Peace Our Real Tsung, CARY-HIROYUKI-TAGAWA!\\n---\\nSoundtrack still hits hard\\n---\\n@dsitan1900 That’s stupid, how can you have Mortal Kombat without Sub Zero\\n---\\nCan't wait to watch it on the big screens\\n---\\nTest your might...\\nKano\\nLiu Kang\\nRaiden\\nJohnny Cage\\nScorpion\\nSub-Zero\\nSonya\\nMORTAL KOMBAT!\\n---\\nDidn't we already do this already in the 90s?\\n---\\nDamn we got some good movies coming this summer can't wait\\n---\\nVeronica Vaughan is my Sonia Blade.\\n---\\nMORTAL KOMBAT!

I can’t wait!\\n---\\nThis looks breathtaking.\\n---\\nLet's hope we see an MC Liu Kang who could go toe to toe with Shao Kahn.\\n---\\nTHIS LOOKS SO GOOD!!!!🥲🥲🥲\\n---\\nBooking it! Lifelong mk fan....\\n---\\nKarl Urban is fine but...that role doesn't suit him anymore. Man, it really should have been The Miz\\n---\\nRaiden: Billy Butcher, you have been chosen for Mortal Ko--\\n\\nButcher: Ye ye ye, fork off there, sunshine\\n---\\nMortal Kombat II: A Johnny Cage Story\\n---\\nAll you have to do is have scorpion saying \\"Get over here\\" for me to watch\\n---\\nJohnny is definitely about to hit that glow kick at the end of the trailer. I can’t wait\\n---\\nSo happy can’t wait just 3 months away\\n---\\nOne of the best instant recharge music\\n---\\nOi hughie im in mortal kombat\\n---\\nAbsolutely Brutality❤ Nostalgic Fatality❤….\\n---\\nDamm the music and the VFX looks amazing!\\n---\\nWhere tf sub zero?\\n---\\nThis is going to be incredible 😳👏🔥\\n---\\nCritics can go watch The Sheep Detectives - this one right here is for the fans🤜🏼🤛🏼\\n---\\nab maaza aayega\\n---\\nIs joe taslim still being the subzero?\\n---\\nI've been sold on this movie ever since they cast Karl Urban as Johnny Cage. This is gonna be great!\\n---\\nThis looks absolutely dope!!!\\nThis is the Mortal Kombat we've been waiting for since the first Mortal Kombat movie in 1996!!\\n\\n*Still not sure if they chose the right Johnny Cage, (he was good in The Boys tho) but I'm still on board. \\nLet's go!!!\\n---\\nNeeds way more Kano.\\n---\\nStill will never understand why they turned the most beautiful women in the history of MK into Brown Caillou\\n---\\nThe only thing that bothers me is that there's over 100 characters and they choose Johnny Cage and Katana as the main ones I hope the movie does justice no hate on Karl Urban I love his energy imo his character is boring I'm talking too soon maybe I'm wrong and it'll satisfy me 😂\\n---\\nI'm so glad they kept going with this version despite the nay sayers after the first movie.  It wasn't good, there's no denying that, but it was enjoyable but it had so much potential.  It's good they're leaning into that potential.\\n---\\nmy idol is Scorpion.. 🥰RIP to Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa aka. Shang Tsun 🙏\\n---\\nThey better not save the shadow kick for the very end 😂\\n---\\nI love it ❤\\n---\\nbeautiful 2001 visual effects <3\\n---\\nWhere is Cole Young?\\n---\\nGoosebumps!\\n---\\noh ok, this fan made still lit\\n---\\nwhy was scott adkins not johnny cage...?\\n---\\nyh cole is dying\\n---\\nTrailer's good 👍\\n---\\nfinish hii*crack voice*mm\\n---\\nCharlie the Unicorn as Johnny Cage\\n---\\nI liked cole. I hope he plays a bignpart in this.\\n---\\nflawless victory\\n---\\n- I want to hear \\"COME HEREEE!!!\\"\\n- The fight scene motions are a little slow.\\n- Did I just see Raiden do his tackle fly, love it. He better yell \\"GeT BaCK iN tHe Caaar\\" and do the flip after it. I don't know what he really says either, lol.\\n- Did I wish the whole cast would be in their late 20's-early 30's? Yes but, I guess this series is about maturing with us the players, we got older so did they. And plus if you had the chance to play as one of your influential figures from your youth. Would you pass that up and not honor a game that formed friendships?\\n- I would love to hear \\"Immortal by Adema\\" playing on with someone working out or one of the fighters saying \\"You can't kill me. I'm Immortal\\" then boom the song starts playing.\\n---\\nhe’s never gonna kill bloody homelander\\n---\\nLooks wild. The nostalgic game just keeps on going. Blessings to you all on your journeys! - John 11:25-26\\n---\\nWhere is vidhut jamwal ??\\n---\\nSaibot better get justice\\n---\\nThat was a very epic sounding trailer. Even the visuals look a lot better.\\n---\\nYour soul is forever. Rest in Peace Our Real Tsung, CARY-HIROYUKI-TAGAWA!\\n---\\nSoundtrack still hits hard\\n---\\n@dsitan1900 That’s stupid, how can you have Mortal Kombat without Sub Zero\\n---\\nCan't wait to watch it on the big screens\\n---\\nTest your might...\\nKano\\nLiu Kang\\nRaiden\\nJohnny Cage\\nScorpion\\nSub-Zero\\nSonya\\nMORTAL KOMBAT!\\n---\\nDidn't we already do this already in the 90s?\\n---\\nDamn we got some good movies coming this summer can't wait\\n---\\nVeronica Vaughan is my Sonia Blade.\\n---\\nMORTAL KOMBAT!

Books and mora go out pretty quickly the higher in level you go. So not finishing leveling characters to 90 and instead using materials to build more characters for fun/theater/making new teams is better.\\n---\\n@Etherion195 For now, it only tracks characters that you own. Yes it can track the talent mats for that character, and yes it tracks the mats for whatever weapon is equipped on them. There’s a new feature where the adventurer’s handbook shows you the domains of the characters you selected (for talent mats and other things)\\n---\\nAino's house theme\\n---\\nAll the talk in the quest of Varka training up various Knights makes me think they're laying the groundwork for a Knight faction.

Maybe even Diluc.\\n\\n...But they also put Varka and several other Knights in the Hexenzirkel faction so ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ I don't know what the plan is. Still, I feel pretty confidant that once they're ready to move on from the 'Witch's Homework' it'll be time for the 'Grandmaster's Training'.

Yes it can track the talent mats for that character, and yes it tracks the mats for whatever weapon is equipped on them. There’s a new feature where the adventurer’s handbook shows you the domains of the characters you selected (for talent mats and other things)\\n---\\nAino's house theme\\n---\\nAll the talk in the quest of Varka training up various Knights makes me think they're laying the groundwork for a Knight faction. God knows Eula could use some help. And Noelle. As well as all the standard Knights that everyone gets. Maybe even Diluc.\\n\\n...But they also put Varka and several other Knights in the Hexenzirkel faction so ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ I don't know what the plan is. Still, I feel pretty confidant that once they're ready to move on from the 'Witch's Homework' it'll be time for the 'Grandmaster's Training'.
